basic-html5-application-setup
=============================

My personal setup for basic HTML5 applications, with libraries and such. The setup is a good starting point for the way I like my Kohana setups, but that's about it.

### Dependencies #
* Sass with Compass, or Less (for design)
* Node with grunt and grunt-shell

Comes bundled with some javascript frameworks/plugins, and several sass and less files.
