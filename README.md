basic-html5-application-setup
=============================

My personal setup for basic HTML5 applications, with libraries and such. 

Dependencies:
- Sass with Compass, or Less (for design)
- Node with grunt and grunt-shell

Comes bundled with some javascript frameworks/plugins, and several sass and less files.
